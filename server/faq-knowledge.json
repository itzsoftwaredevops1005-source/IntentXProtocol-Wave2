    {
      "id": "what-is-intentx",
      "question": "What is IntentX?",
      "answer": "IntentX is an intent-based DeFi aggregator that allows users to describe their financial goals in natural language and automatically executes them across multiple blockchains. It combines DEX trading, lending/borrowing, and staking in one unified interface."
    },
    {
      "id": "how-intent-parsing",
      "question": "How does intent parsing work?",
      "answer": "Simply describe your goal in plain English in the Intent Lab. Our AI breaks it down into executable steps, estimates gas costs, and shows you a preview before execution. Examples: 'Swap 100 USDC for ETH', 'Stake 50 ETH in Lido', 'Supply 5000 USDC to Aave'."
    },
    {
      "id": "supported-defi-primitives",
      "question": "What are the supported DeFi primitives?",
      "answer": "IntentX supports three core primitives: (1) DEX Trading - swap tokens using AMM protocols, (2) Lending/Borrowing - supply assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral, (3) Staking - earn rewards by staking tokens in various vaults."
    },
    {
      "id": "networks-supported",
      "question": "Which networks are supported?",
      "answer": "IntentX operates on 4 networks: BlockDAG Testnet (primary), Ethereum Goerli, Polygon Mumbai, and Hardhat Local (development). Select your preferred network using the network selector in the navbar."
    },
    {
      "id": "transaction-optimization",
      "question": "How are transactions optimized?",
      "answer": "IntentX uses batch processing, multi-hop routing, and smart protocol selection to minimize gas costs. We achieve sub-2 second perceived execution times through optimistic UI updates and efficient transaction bundling."
    },
    {
      "id": "vault-apy",
      "question": "What are the vault APYs?",
      "answer": "Our 6 vaults offer competitive yields: ETH Staking (5.2%), WETH Staking (5.8%), stETH Staking (18.5%), USDC Lending (7.2%), DAI Lending (6.8%), USDT Lending (7.5%). APYs are variable and subject to market conditions."
    },
    {
      "id": "security-features",
      "question": "What are the security features?",
      "answer": "Security is paramount. We use audited smart contracts, multi-sig governance, non-custodial wallet integration, gas-safe patterns, proper access controls, and real-time risk monitoring. Always verify transactions before execution."
    },
    {
      "id": "gas-saved-calculation",
      "question": "How is gas saved calculated?",
      "answer": "Gas savings are calculated by comparing your optimized route vs. a standard single-protocol approach. Multi-hop routing and batching typically save 20-40% in gas fees. Actual savings depend on market conditions and transaction complexity."
    },
    {
      "id": "wallet-connection",
      "question": "How do I connect my wallet?",
      "answer": "Click the 'Connect Wallet' button in the top-right navbar. MetaMask will open - select your account, approve the connection, and you'll be ready to create intents and execute transactions. Your private keys never leave your device."
    },
    {
      "id": "borrow-requirements",
      "question": "What are the borrow requirements?",
      "answer": "To borrow, you must first supply collateral. Our lending pools use a 75% LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio, meaning you can borrow up to 75% of your collateral value. Interest rates are 3-8% depending on the asset."
